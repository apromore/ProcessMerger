------------------------
ProcessMerge v0.6
------------------------

Requirements: Java 6 or above

What it does:

	ProcessMerge is a tool for merging process models represented in the EPC Markup Language (EPML)

How:
	ProcessMerge implements the process model merging techniques described in the report "Merging Business Process Models (Extended Version)" by M. La Rosa, M. Dumas, R. Uba and R. Dijkman (see: http://eprints.qut.edu.au/29120/).

USAGE 1:
java -jar ProcessMerger [-mt=mt_value] [-ct=ct_value] [-ent=[true|false]] [-digest=frequency] [-alg=[g|h]] [-name=merged_name] <nameOfFile1.epml> <nameOfFile2.epml> ... <nameOfFilen.epml>

	Input: 	Two or more (configurable) EPC process models encoded in the EPML notation.
	Output: A (configurable) EPC process model in EPML.

Parameters:
	-mt: threshold for non connector nodes, if similarity for nodes is >= threshold, then two nodes are merged, default value=0.5
	-ct: threshold for connector nodes, if similarity for connectors is >= threshold, then 2 connectors are merged, default value=0.75
	-ent: defines if mapped pairs that generate entanglement should be removed or not, if true, entanglement pairs will be removed, default value=true
	-digest: computes the digest of the merged model. Needs parameter frequency of type integer. All the nodes that occur at least digest_value times will be added to digest.
	-alg: algorithm that is used to compute the similairity between each pair of models. Value: h: hungarian, g: greedy, default is greedy.
	-name: name of the merged model, by default the concatenation of merged model names is used.

All parameters are optional. 

USAGE 2:
java -jar ProcessMerger -digest=frequency <nameOfMergedModel.epml> 

	Input: 	A configurable EPC process model encoded in the EPML notation.
	Output: An EPC process model in EPML represeting the digest of the input model.

Parameters:
	-digest: computes the digest of the merged model. Needs parameter frequency of type integer. All the nodes that occur at least digest_value times will be added to digest.


How to visualize the output:
	EPML models can be visualized using one of the following tools:
        Apromore, available at: www.apromore.qut.edu.au

	The C-iEPC Designer available at:
        http://www.processconfiguration.com/download.html
        
	The ProM toolkit available at: http://www.processmining.org

        The output of ProcessMerge is a configurable EPC, meaning that some 
        of the connectors are marked as "configurable" and contain attributes
        that allow one to trace the provenance of each branch of the connector.

Assumptions:
		
	The input should be formatted according the the EPC Markup Language:
	http://www.mendling.com/EPML/
        To check that the input models are correctly formatted, you can open
        the input models using the ProM toolkit. 
	Special characters such €, >, < require XML escape methods in EPML. 


        Two sample EPML files are provided with the tool distribution.

Release notes:

	0.6: fixed non-determinism issue with similarity search arising when two or more model pairs yield the same matching score
	0.5: initial release
