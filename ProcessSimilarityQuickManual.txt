ProcessSimilarity v0.6
------------------------

Requirements: Java 6 or above

What it does:

	ProcessSimilarity is a tool for computing the similarity of two process models represented in the EPC Markup Language (EPML)

How:
	ProcessSimilarity implements the process model similarity techniques described in the report "Business Process Model Merging: An Approach to Business Process Consolidation" by M. La Rosa, M. Dumas, R. Uba and R. Dijkman (see: http://eprints.qut.edu.au/38241/).

USAGE:
java -jar ProcessSimilarity [-mt=mt_value] [-ct=ct_value] [-ent=[true|false]] [-alg=[g|h]] <nameOfFile1.epml> <nameOfFile2.epml>

	Input: 	Two or more (configurable) EPC process models encoded in the EPML notation.
	Output: A decimal value between 0 and 1 representing the similarity between the two input models, where 0 means that processes are not similar and 1 means that the processes are the same.

Parameters:
	-mt: threshold for non connector nodes, if similarity for nodes is >= threshold, then two nodes are merged, default value=0.5
	-ct: threshold for connector nodes, if similarity for connectors is >= threshold, then 2 connectors are merged, default value=0.75
	-ent: defines if mapped pairs that generate entanglement should be removed or not, if true, entanglement pairs will be removed, default value=true
	-digest: computes the digest of the merged model. Needs parameter frequency of type integer. All the nodes that occur at least digest_value times will be added to digest.
	-alg: algorithm that is used to compute the similairity between each pair of models. Value: h: hungarian, g: greedy, default is greedy.

All parameters are optional. 


Assumptions:
		
	The input should be formatted according the the EPC Markup Language:
	http://www.mendling.com/EPML/
        To check that the input models are correctly formatted, you can open
        the input models using the ProM toolkit. 
	Special characters  such €, >, < require XML escape methods in EPML. 


        Two sample EPML files are provided with the tool distribution.

Release notes:

	0.6: fixed non-determinism issue with similarity search arising when two or more model pairs yield the same matching score
	0.5: initial release
